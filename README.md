### Hi there, I'm [Damian!](https://damian.dzieduch.pl) ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a full stack web developer. I enjoy working on web-related projects, especially in an opensource environment.

My current tech stack usually combines Laravel (PHP) on the backend and Vue (JS) on the frontend. I like to use NextJS and headless CMS.
